### Restaurant-Recommendation-System-using-Yelp-Dataset
This is an academic project for CSP-571 Data Preparation And Analysis. 
In this project we built a personalized recommender system using Yelp dataset of restaurants. We tested various models like Pure Collaborative, Approximate Nearest Neighbour, K-NN, Naive Bayes and Hybrid Maxtrix Factorization. 
We tested the models using AUC which is a decision-support metric that checks whether customers like the item or not. In our case, figuring out customer preference in general is more important and practical.
