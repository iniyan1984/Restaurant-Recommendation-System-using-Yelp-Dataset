### Restaurant-Recommendation-System-using-Yelp-Dataset
This is our academic project for CSP-571 "Data Preparation And Analysis". 
In this project we built a personalized recommender web app using Yelp dataset of restaurants. We tested various models like Pure Collaborative, Approximate Nearest Neighbour, K-NN, Naive Bayes and Hybrid Maxtrix Factorization on various hyperparameters which were tuned using the library "scikit optimizer"
We tested the models using AUC which is a decision-support metric that checks whether customers like the item or not. In our case, figuring out customer preference in general is more important and practical. 

And for deployment, we used Angular8 and Flask frameworks.
